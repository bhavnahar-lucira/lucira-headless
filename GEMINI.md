# Project Instructions

- **Contextual Precedence:** Always check this file and the `MEMORY.md` index before starting any task.
- **Architecture:** This project is a frontend-only Next.js application. All product, collection, and search data must be fetched directly from the Shopify Storefront API with a 1-hour cache (`revalidate: 3600`).
- **Database:** MongoDB Atlas is used strictly for transactional/user data: Cart, Wishlist, Orders, Pincodes, Stores, Announcements, Styled Videos, and Curated Looks. Products and collections are NOT stored in the database.
- **Surgical Updates:** Strictly avoid changing or updating any existing working code or logic unless it is the direct cause of a bug or explicitly requested. 
- **Preservation:** All additions should be purely to handle specific edge cases or new requirements without disrupting the established codebase architecture.
- **Shopify GIDs:** Specific handling for Shopify GID resolution (e.g., Pages, Metaobjects) should be implemented in the relevant API routes to ensure clean data delivery to the frontend.
